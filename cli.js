This is a pewter: one folder that is a git repository, an npm project, and
the channel between this machine and the Pewter page at once.

## How to work here

- \`pewt\` is the command line, installed in this pewter and not globally.
  Everything the page can do, it does by calling the same operations \u2014
  \`pewt --help\` lists them.
- Screens live in \`extensions/\`. One is a directory with an \`index.html\`
  and a \`main.ts\`; it imports \`pewter\` for the API and is bundled into a
  single file when a tab opens it. There is no plugin API to learn.
- Projects live in \`repos/\`, each its own git repository, and none of them
  are committed here.

## One thing that is not finished

\`pewt check\` \u2014 which compiles \`extensions/\` and reports what is wrong before
anything reaches a screen \u2014 does not exist yet. It is the feedback signal an
agent writing an extension can run alone, so until it lands the only way to
know a screen works is to open it and look.

## What is worth committing

This pewter is yours and its history is the record of how it changed. An
extension you wrote, a template you adjusted, a script you added: all of it
is code somebody can read, including you in six months.

yours: pick this folder in the browser and allow it. Picking and allowing are
gestures only Chrome can offer, and they are what stops the page from
